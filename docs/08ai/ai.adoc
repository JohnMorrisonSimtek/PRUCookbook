== Moving to the BeagleBone AI

So far all our examples have focussed on the BeagleBone Black and Pocket Beagle.
These are both based on the am335x chip.  The new kid on the black in the BeagleBone AI
which is based on the am5729. The new chip brings with it new capabilities one of
which is four PRUs.  This chapter details what changes when moving from two to
four PRUs.

The following are resources used in this chapter.

=== Moving from two to four PRUs
==== Problem
You have code that works on the am335x PRUs and you want to move it to the 
am5729 on the AI.

==== Solution

==== Discission

=== Seeing how pins are configured
==== Problem
You want to know how the pins are currently configured.

==== Solution
The `show-pins.pl` command does what you want, but you have to set it up first.

----
bone$ *cd ~/bin*
bone$ *ln -s /opt/scripts/device/bone/show-pins.pl .*
----

This creates a symbolic link to the `show-pins.pl` command that is rather hidden
away.  The link is put in the `bin` directory which is in the default command
`$PATH`.  Now you can run `show-pins.pl` from anywhere.

bone$ *show-pins.pl*

P8.33b                    58  AF9 e fast    down gpio3_1
...
----
Here you see `P9.19a` and `P9.20a` are configured for i2c with pull up resistors.
The `P8` pins are configured as gpio with pull down resistors. They are 
both on gpio port 3.  `P8.35b` is bit 0 while `P8.33b` is bit 1. You can find
which direction they are set by using `gpioinfo` and the chip number.  
Unfortunately you subtract one from the port number to get the chip number.
So `P8.35b` is on chip number 2.

Here we see both (lines 0 and 1) are set to input.

Adding `-v` gives more details.

The best way to use `show-pins.pl` is with `grep`.  To see all the pru pins try:

bone$ *show-pins.pl  | grep -i pru | sort*

P9.20b                    94   D2 c fast rx  up  pr1_pru1_gpi1
----

Here we have nine pins configured for the PRU registers `R30` and `R31`.
Five are input pins and four are out.

=== Configuring pins on the AI via device trees
==== Problem
I want to configure another pin for the PRU, but I get an error.
[source] 
[subs=+quotes]
----
bone$ *config-pin P8.12 pruout*
ERROR: open() for /sys/devices/platform/ocp/ocp:P8_12_pinmux/state failed, No such file or directory
----

==== Solution
The pins on the AI must be configure at boot time and therefor cannot be
configured with `config-pin`.  Instead you must edit the device tree.

==== Discission
Suppose you want to make `P8.12` a PRU output pin. First go to the
https://github.com/beagleboard/beaglebone-ai/wiki/System-Reference-Manual#p8.10-p8.13[am5729 System Reference Manual]
and look up `P8.12`.  
[TIP]
====
The https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dFSBVem86vAUD7MLXvqdS-N0Efi8_g_O1iTqzql8DAo/edit#gid=0[BeagleBone AI PRU pins]
table may be easier to use.
====

We see that when `P8.12` is set to `MODE13` it will be a PRU out pin.  
`MODE12` makes it a PRU in pin.  It appears at bit 3 on PRU1_1.

Next, find which kernel you are running.

I'm running the 4.14 version. Now look in `/opt/source` for your kernel.

bone$ *ls am5729**
am5729-beagleboneai.dts  am5729-beagleboneai-roboticscape.dts
----
`am5729-beagleboneai.dts` is the file we need to edit.  Search for `P8.12`.
You'l see:
[subs=+quotes]
----
DRA7XX_CORE_IOPAD(0x3510, MUX_MODE14) // AH4: P8.11: vin1a_d7.off 
DRA7XX_CORE_IOPAD(0x350C, *MUX_MODE14*) // AG6: *P8.12*: vin1a_d6.off 
DRA7XX_CORE_IOPAD(0x3590, PIN_INPUT | MUX_MODE12) // D3: P8.13: vin2a_d10.off 
----

Change the `MUX_MODE14` to `MUX_MODE13` for output, or `MUX_MODE12` for input.

Compile and install.  The first time will take a while since it recompiles all
the dts files.
